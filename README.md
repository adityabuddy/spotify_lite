# Spotify-lite System

This project is a backend system designed to mimic core functionalities of a music streaming service like Spotify. It provides a RESTful API for managing artists, albums, tracks, and user-created playlists.

The system is built using a modern, high-performance tech stack, emphasizing a clear architecture, data validation, and a robust database solution.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for managing music data and playlists.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses a MySQL database to store and manage all application data.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: SQLAlchemy is used to interact with the database using Python objects, abstracting away raw SQL.
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic ensures data integrity for all API requests and responses.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A simple tool to easily populate the database with initial data.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite using `pytest` to ensure all API endpoints function as expected.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: `FastAPI` (Python)
- **Database**: `MySQL`
- **Database ORM**: `SQLAlchemy`
- **Data Validation**: `Pydantic`
- **Web Server**: `Uvicorn`
- **Testing**: `pytest`, `requests`

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files to maintain a clear separation of concerns:

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files to maintain a clear separation of concerns:

spotify-lite-system/
├── main.py             # Main FastAPI application and API endpoints
├── database.py         # Handles the MySQL database connection
├── models.py           # SQLAlchemy database models (tables)
├── schemas.py          # Pydantic schemas for data validation
├── cli.py              # CLI tool for basic data entry
├── seed_db.py          # Script for bulk data insertion

└── tests/
└── test_api.py     # API test suite


## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- MySQL server installed and running.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd spotify-lite-system
3. Set Up the Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You can generate this file with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all dependencies.)

5. Configure the Database
Create a MySQL Database:

SQL

CREATE DATABASE spotify_lite;
Update the Connection String: Open database.py and modify the DATABASE_URL with your MySQL credentials.

Python

DATABASE_URL = "mysql+mysqlconnector://<user>:<password>@localhost:3306/spotify_lite"
6. Create Database Tables
Run the create_tables.py script to automatically create all the necessary tables based on your SQLAlchemy models.

Bash

python create_tables.py
7. Populate the Database with Seed Data
Use the seed_db.py script to insert a large amount of sample data into the database.

Bash

python seed_db.py
Running the Application
To start the FastAPI server, run the following command from the root directory:

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. You can access it at:

Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

Testing
To run the full test suite, use pytest:

Bash

pytest
